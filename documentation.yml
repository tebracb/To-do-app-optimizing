                  Technical documentation of the Todo-app project. The application
                  is built following the Model View Controller design pattern (see model.js, view.js, controller.js).

                  Top-level file is app.js from where the single model, controller, and view objects are created.
                  Storage of the todo's is handled by store.js which stores the todo's in the browser's local storage but can easily support different destinations.  

                  The testing framework used in this project is Jasmine. The Spec files can be found under the tests folder.
